# ac-cars-data-getter
Gets data from all your Assetto Corsa cars and puts it in a csv.
Also tries to assign a race class to race cars

## Usage
- Point data_dir in line 16 to your Assetto Corsa cars folder
- Run the file
- Open cars_data.csv in Excel, Google Sheets or something similar

## Known issues
- Some cars get left blank. Probably because of malformed ui_car.json, but I'm not sure
- Works best with my own system of tagging cars in AC
